/* Tasks Remaining
    - Create boolean algebra table and algorithm for biasing the bitstream with a percentage of 1's
    - Take command line input for number of bytes and the percentage of ones... do calculations to determine if possible and output error message if required
    - python analysis of data file to calculate autocorrelation, cross correlation shannon entropy etc.
    - calculate total runtime of the program
    - adjust makefile
    - C/python library for nist test or any other statistical testing
